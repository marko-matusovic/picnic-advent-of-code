# 🎄 Picnic Trip Day: The Tote Conveyor 🎄

You are excited to be on a special field trip to the **Picnic Fulfillment Center (FC)**. It's a marvel of modern
logistics: conveyor belts whirring overhead, shoppers picking groceries into red and black totes, and the fleet
of cute **Electric Picnic Vehicles (EPVs)** lining up at the loading bay.

You are admiring the automation when, suddenly, the Chief Elf drops his clipboard.

"Stop the line! STOP THE LINE!" he screams, pointing at the loading bay.

You look over and see an EPV rolling out of the dock. It's leaning heavily to the left, and one of its frames is
carrying only a single, lonely tote.

"The `LOAD_BALANCER_V1` firmware has cracked under the Christmas pressure!" the Chief Elf cries, panic rising in his
voice. "It's sending out half-empty frames and unbalanced EPVs. If the milkman runs are unstable, the Christmas
puddings will slide around and get ruined\!"

He spots the sticker on your laptop. "You\! You know algorithms, right? Plug into the Dispatch Server. We need to
rewrite the **Stacking** and **Frame Loading** protocols immediately\!"

You take a deep breath and proceed to [part 1](./PART_1.md).
